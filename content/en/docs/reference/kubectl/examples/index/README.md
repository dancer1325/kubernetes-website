# Examples: Common operations

Use the following set of examples to help you familiarize yourself with running the commonly used `kubectl` operations:

`kubectl apply` - Apply or Update a resource from a file or stdin.

```shell
# Create a service using the definition in example-service.yaml.
kubectl apply -f example-service.yaml

# Create a replication controller using the definition in example-controller.yaml.
kubectl apply -f example-controller.yaml

# Create the objects that are defined in any .yaml, .yml, or .json file within the <directory> directory.
kubectl apply -f <directory>
```

`kubectl get` - List one or more resources.

```shell
# List all pods in plain-text output format.
kubectl get pods

# List all pods in plain-text output format and include additional information (such as node name).
kubectl get pods -o wide

# List the replication controller with the specified name in plain-text output format. Tip: You can shorten and replace the 'replicationcontroller' resource type with the alias 'rc'.
kubectl get replicationcontroller <rc-name>

# List all replication controllers and services together in plain-text output format.
kubectl get rc,services

# List all daemon sets in plain-text output format.
kubectl get ds

# List all pods running on node server01
kubectl get pods --field-selector=spec.nodeName=server01
```

`kubectl describe` - Display detailed state of one or more resources, including the uninitialized ones by default.

```shell
# Display the details of the node with name <node-name>.
kubectl describe nodes <node-name>

# Display the details of the pod with name <pod-name>.
kubectl describe pods/<pod-name>

# Display the details of all the pods that are managed by the replication controller named <rc-name>.
# Remember: Any pods that are created by the replication controller get prefixed with the name of the replication controller.
kubectl describe pods <rc-name>

# Describe all pods
kubectl describe pods
```

{{< note >}}
The `kubectl get` command is usually used for retrieving one or more
resources of the same resource type. It features a rich set of flags that allows
you to customize the output format using the `-o` or `--output` flag, for example.
You can specify the `-w` or `--watch` flag to start watching updates to a particular
object. The `kubectl describe` command is more focused on describing the many
related aspects of a specified resource. It may invoke several API calls to the
API server to build a view for the user. For example, the `kubectl describe node`
command retrieves not only the information about the node, but also a summary of
the pods running on it, the events generated for the node etc.

`kubectl delete` - Delete resources either from a file, stdin, or specifying label selectors, names, resource selectors, or resources.

```shell
# Delete a pod using the type and name specified in the pod.yaml file.
kubectl delete -f pod.yaml

# Delete all the pods and services that have the label '<label-key>=<label-value>'.
kubectl delete pods,services -l <label-key>=<label-value>

# Delete all pods, including uninitialized ones.
kubectl delete pods --all
```

`kubectl exec` - Execute a command against a container in a pod.

```shell
# Get output from running 'date' from pod <pod-name>. By default, output is from the first container.
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- date

# Get output from running 'date' in container <container-name> of pod <pod-name>.
kubectl exec <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- date

# Get an interactive TTY and run /bin/bash from pod <pod-name>. By default, output is from the first container.
kubectl exec -ti <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```

`kubectl logs` - Print the logs for a container in a pod.

```shell
# Return a snapshot of the logs from pod <pod-name>.
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Start streaming the logs from pod <pod-name>. This is similar to the 'tail -f' Linux command.
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
```

`kubectl diff` - View a diff of the proposed updates to a cluster.

```shell
# Diff resources included in "pod.json".
kubectl diff -f pod.json

# Diff file read from stdin.
cat service.yaml | kubectl diff -f -
```

# Examples: Creating and using plugins

Use the following set of examples to help you familiarize yourself with writing and using `kubectl` plugins:

```shell
# create a simple plugin in any language and name the resulting executable file
# so that it begins with the prefix "kubectl-"
cat ./kubectl-hello
```
```shell
#!/bin/sh

# this plugin prints the words "hello world"
echo "hello world"
```
With a plugin written, let's make it executable:
```bash
chmod a+x ./kubectl-hello

# and move it to a location in our PATH
sudo mv ./kubectl-hello /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin

# You have now created and "installed" a kubectl plugin.
# You can begin using this plugin by invoking it from kubectl as if it were a regular command
kubectl hello
```
```
hello world
```

```shell
# You can "uninstall" a plugin, by removing it from the folder in your
# $PATH where you placed it
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/kubectl-hello
```

In order to view all of the plugins that are available to `kubectl`, use
the `kubectl plugin list` subcommand:

```shell
kubectl plugin list
```
The output is similar to:
```
The following kubectl-compatible plugins are available:

/usr/local/bin/kubectl-hello
/usr/local/bin/kubectl-foo
/usr/local/bin/kubectl-bar
```

`kubectl plugin list` also warns you about plugins that are not
executable, or that are shadowed by other plugins; for example:

```shell
sudo chmod -x /usr/local/bin/kubectl-foo # remove execute permission
kubectl plugin list
```

```
The following kubectl-compatible plugins are available:

/usr/local/bin/kubectl-hello
/usr/local/bin/kubectl-foo
  - warning: /usr/local/bin/kubectl-foo identified as a plugin, but it is not executable
/usr/local/bin/kubectl-bar

error: one plugin warning was found
```

You can think of plugins as a means to build more complex functionality on top
of the existing kubectl commands:

```shell
cat ./kubectl-whoami
```

The next few examples assume that you already made `kubectl-whoami` have
the following contents:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# this plugin makes use of the `kubectl config` command in order to output
# information about the current user, based on the currently selected context
kubectl config view --template='{{ range .contexts }}{{ if eq .name "'$(kubectl config current-context)'" }}Current user: {{ printf "%s\n" .context.user }}{{ end }}{{ end }}'
```

Running the above command gives you an output containing the user for the
current context in your KUBECONFIG file:

```shell
# make the file executable
sudo chmod +x ./kubectl-whoami

# and move it into your PATH
sudo mv ./kubectl-whoami /usr/local/bin

kubectl whoami
Current user: plugins-user
```
